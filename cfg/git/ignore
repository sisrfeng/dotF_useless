# Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files
# generated by the user’s editor of choice) generally go into a file. 默认是这个文件 

# foo:  matches file or directory `foo` anywhere
## 这两行一样：
# **/foo
# foo
#
#
# doc/frotz and /doc/frotz have the same effect in any .gitignore file.
# In other words, a leading slash is not relevant if there is already a middle slash in the pattern.
